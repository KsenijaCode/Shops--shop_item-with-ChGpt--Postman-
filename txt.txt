Here's a simple CRUD API using Express and JavaScript that manages shops and their items. This implementation stores the data in memory, so it will reset every time the server restarts.


API Endpoints Overview
Shops:

POST /shops: Create a new shop.
GET /shops: Retrieve all shops.
GET /shops/:id: Retrieve a specific shop by ID.
PUT /shops/:id: Update a specific shop by ID.
DELETE /shops/:id: Delete a specific shop by ID.


Items:

POST /shops/:shopId/items: Create a new item for a specific shop.
GET /shops/:shopId/items: Retrieve all items for a specific shop.
GET /items/:id: Retrieve a specific item by ID.
PUT /items/:id: Update a specific item by ID.
DELETE /items/:id: Delete a specific item by ID.


Instructions to Run:

Save the file with a name, e.g., app.js.
Run npm init -y in the same directory to create a package.json file.
Install Express by running npm install express.
Start the server by running node app.js.
Use tools like Postman or cURL to test the API.
